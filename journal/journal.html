            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some
            interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li> Walla walla</li> 
            <li>Wa</li>
            <li>MagicCity</li>
            <li>ID</li>
        </ol>
            Last chance.

            I saw some Burna Shave style signs on the side of the road 
            today: <blockquote>
                  "Passing cars,<br>
                   When you cant see,<br>
                   May get you,<br> 
                   A glimpse,<br>
                   of eternity."<br>
                </blockquote> I definitly wont be passing any cars.

            My first day of the trip! I cant belive I finally got
            everything packed and ready to go. Becouse Im on a Segway,
            I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, Ipod,
            digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As 
            Loa Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousands miles beguins
            with in Segway.</q>
